## ‚≠êÔ∏è Priorities: What to Tackle Next

### 1. **Persistence for User Preferences**
Add persistence (e.g., via UserDefaults) for features like "hidden project suggestions." This will improve user experience and introduce you to saving custom settings.

### 2. **Error Handling**
Replace force-unwraps (`!`) and add user-friendly error messages/alerts for failed saves or data issues. This is essential for reliability.

### 3. **Testing Your Logic**
Start using the Swift Testing macros to write tests for your data calculations and sorting functions. It's a great first step into professional software development.

### 4. **UI Accessibility**
Add accessibility labels and check color contrast for all user-facing controls and icons.

### 5. **Small UI/UX Polish**
Finish small polish items like using consistent colors, extracting repeated views, and subtle animations.

## üìã Full Suggestion List

### üåü Positive Feedback
- **Separation of Concerns:** Good use of separate files and views for code organization.
- **Modern SwiftUI:** Uses `@State`, `.onChange`, `.sheet`, and SwiftData‚Äôs `@Query` and `@Model`.
- **User Experience:** Includes scroll-to, keyboard management, and focus handling.
- **Model Design:** `Identifiable` conformance and model relationships are well set up.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Suggestions for Improvement

#### 1. **Persistence and UserDefaults**
- Store user preferences (e.g., hidden suggestions) in UserDefaults, or in your data model, so these settings persist between launches.

#### 2. **Error Handling**
- Use `do/catch` blocks and avoid force-unwrapping (`!`) to make the app more robust.
- Consider user-facing alerts for important errors (e.g., failed saves).

#### 3. **Testing**
- Use the new Swift Testing macros to test your logic (like fee calculations and project sorting).
- Example: Write tests for functions in your extensions.

#### 4. **Accessibility**
- Add accessibility labels (for VoiceOver) to buttons, icons, and form fields.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and text sizes.

#### 5. **UI Consistency**
- Define custom colors in one place (e.g., asset catalog or a color extension).
- Review font sizes and padding for uniformity.

#### 6. **Model Refinement and Schema**
- Add all models (Project, Client, Item, Invoice, etc.) to the SwiftData schema in your `Ledger_8App.swift`, to avoid future errors.
- If you want to support multiple users, think about sharing/syncing data.

#### 7. **Refactoring & Reusability**
- Extract repeated UI elements (like labeled content) into reusable `View` structs.
- Use extensions to organize large view files.

#### 8. **Animations & Transitions**
- Explore using more `.withAnimation` and `.transition` for interactive UI elements.

#### 9. **Documentation**
- Add comments where logic is complex or not obvious.
- Document your helper functions and extensions.

#### 10. **App Theming**
- Consider supporting custom themes (color and font size) using `@AppStorage` and environment values.

#### 11. **Onboarding Flow**
- Continue enhancing the onboarding experience. It's already using `@AppStorage`, which is great.

#### 12. **Next-level Features**
- Add search and filtering to project/client lists.
- Enable export or sharing for invoices.
- Integrate with the system calendar for project dates.
- Expand on your Swift Charts analytics.
