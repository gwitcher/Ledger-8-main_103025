# Service Migration Summary

## Successfully Updated Views

### 1. **FeeTotalsView.swift**
- ✅ Replaced `projectsFeeTotal(projects:)` calls with `ProjectService.projectsFeeTotal(projects:)`
- ✅ Removed duplicate local `projectsFeeTotal` method
- ✅ Updated header comments

### 2. **AddInvoiceView.swift**
- ✅ Replaced `project.nextInvoiceNumber(...)` with `ProjectService.nextInvoiceNumber(...)`
- ✅ Replaced `project.renderInvoice(...)` with `InvoiceService.renderInvoice(...)`
- ✅ Updated header comments

### 3. **ProjectDetailView.swift**
- ✅ Replaced `project.calculateFeeTotal(...)` with `ProjectService.calculateFeeTotal(...)`

### 4. **IncomeByMonthView.swift**
- ✅ Updated both instances of `project.calculateFeeTotal(...)` to `ProjectService.calculateFeeTotal(...)`

### 5. **MediaTypeDonutChartView.swift**
- ✅ Updated both instances in `mediaTypeTotals` computed property and `totalFee` function
- ✅ Replaced `project.calculateFeeTotal(...)` with `ProjectService.calculateFeeTotal(...)`

### 6. **MainView.swift**
- ✅ Uncommented the entire file (it was previously commented out)
- ✅ The view is now active and ready to use

## Migration Benefits

### ✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic moved to dedicated service classes
- Views are now cleaner and focused on UI

### ✅ **Improved Testability**
- Services can be easily unit tested
- Business logic is decoupled from UI

### ✅ **Better Code Organization**
- Related functionality grouped in logical service classes
- Extensions now contain only convenience methods

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Original extension methods marked as `@available(*, deprecated)`
- Migration can be done gradually

## New File Structure

```
Services/
├── ProjectService.swift      // Fee calculations and project utilities
└── InvoiceService.swift      // PDF generation and invoice handling

Extensions/
├── ProjectExtensions.swift   // Convenient Project model extensions
├── DateExtensions.swift      // Date utility methods
└── ViewExtensions.swift      // SwiftUI view helpers

Extensions.swift             // Legacy support and central import point
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the updated views** to ensure they work correctly with the new services
2. **Consider removing deprecated methods** after confirming all views work properly
3. **Add unit tests** for the new service classes
4. **Update any remaining views** that might be using the old methods

## Usage Examples

### Old Way (Deprecated)
```swift
let total = project.calculateFeeTotal(items: items)
let invoice = project.renderInvoice(project: project, invoiceNumber: 1)
```

### New Way (Recommended)
```swift
let total = ProjectService.calculateFeeTotal(items: items)
let invoice = InvoiceService.renderInvoice(project: project, invoiceNumber: 1)
```

The migration is complete! All identified views have been successfully updated to use the new service-based architecture.
