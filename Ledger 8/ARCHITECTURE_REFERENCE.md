## üèóÔ∏è **Data Architecture**

### **Core Entity Relationships**
```
Project (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (0..1) Client
Project (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (0..*) Item  [cascade delete]
Project (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (0..1) Invoice [cascade delete]
```

### **SwiftData Schema**
```swift
// CURRENT (Potential Issue)
let schema = Schema([Project.self])

// SHOULD BE
let schema = Schema([Project.self, Client.self, Item.self, Invoice.self])
```

### **ID Management & Consistency**
**Current State:**
- `Client` model: Uses explicit `id: UUID` property
- `Project` model: Relies on SwiftData's auto-generated `PersistentIdentifier`
- `Item` and `Invoice` models: TBD (likely using `PersistentIdentifier`)

**Recommended Improvement:**
```swift
// Add explicit UUID to Project model for consistency
@Model
class Project: Identifiable {
    var id: UUID  // Add explicit UUID
    // ... existing properties
    
    init(id: UUID = UUID(), ...) {
        self.id = id
        // ... existing initialization
    }
}
```

**Benefits of UUID Consistency:**
- Predictable string conversion (`uuid.uuidString`)
- Better backup/export reliability
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easier testing with known IDs
- Migration safety and control

### **Data Persistence**
- **SwiftData:** Core project/client/item data
- **@AppStorage:** User preferences, company info, banking details
- **File System:** Generated PDF invoices in Documents directory

## üö® **Known Issues & Improvement Areas**

### **Critical**

- Calendar integration 
- Email functionality
- Data export capabilities  
- Advanced analytics features
- **Model consistency**: Standardize all models to use explicit `UUID` IDs
